# helpful-python-functions
These are a collection of python functions that I created and found helpful as I came across generalizable problems.

File Structure
* `requirements` contains all the dependencies for the created functions. They are of the format {function_name}_requirements.txt
* functions contains all the python code for defining each function. They are of the format {function_name}.py
